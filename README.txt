This is my attempt to complete course cs61a taught at Berkeley during spring 2011.
The course is based on fantastic "Structure and interpretation of computer programs".
Instructor is Brian Harvey and he's extremely good at this.
The lovely thing is that Berkeley got online everything you need to take this course remotely. Thank you.

I'm trying to
 - do readings on sicp: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/ (of course i bought a printed copy)
 - watch video lectures: https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E
 - do homework: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs61a/reader/nodate-hw.pdf
 - do projects: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs61a/reader/vol1.html

 - take final: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~cs61a/reader/vol2.html
